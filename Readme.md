# Chat Animated App

Hi üññüèΩ this is an **chat animated**, The project was made with React Native using **Expo** and **Typescript**

## Functionality

The project's functionality is very simple, it simulates a chat and the difference is in the chat response animation that I implemented a **delay**, something similar to a **typewriter effect**.

## Open and run the project

Clone this repository with **git clone https://github.com/felipeamodio/chat-animated-app** or download the files, and after that:

- run **yarn** or **npm i** to install all depencencies
- run **npx expo start**
- this project only works with your physical cell phone, so download Expo Go in stores and read the QR-Code with your cell phone that will appear after you run the expo start command in the terminal
